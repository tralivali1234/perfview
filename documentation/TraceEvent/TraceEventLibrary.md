# The Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent Library

The TraceEvent library is a library that allows you to both collect and process event data.
It was originally designed to parse Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) events that the Windows
operating system can generate.   This is the library that PerfView uses
to do most of its data manipulations, so if you are trying to automate the processing of
some data that you can see in PerfView, there is a very good chance that you want to use
the TraceEvent library to do it.  

Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent is a [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent/)  available from nuget.org.   This library works on both the .NET Desktop (V4.5 and up) as well
a .NET Core (NetStandard 1.6 and up).   Parts of the library work on Linux, but ETW is a Windows
specific technology and thus that part (which is alot of the package) only works on Windows.   

The data model for ETW data is non-trivial, and the data is large (which means that you have to care
about efficiency).  There is also the question of decoding events (they are logged as binary
blobs) as well as the parsing of stack information (which needs symbol files or .NET Events to decode
properly).   This makes the 'data model' exposed by the TraceEvent package non-trivial
and requires some explanation.

* [TraceEvent Programmers Guide](./TraceEventProgrammersGuide.md) 

Is your guide for this.    Fundamentally however, the traceEvent library simply provides
a set of .NET class definitions as a Nuget Package.   Thus you only need to create a .NET
project (it can be .NET Core or .Net Desktop), add a reference to the Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent nuget library
(right click on the project -> Manage Nuget Packages) and start using the APIs.  Here 
is a trivial example that logs all the kernel, clr and dyanmic events in an ETL (ETW Trace File). 
```
    using Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing;
    using System;

    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            using (var source = new ETWTraceEventSource("ETWData.etl"))
            {
                // setup the callbacks
                source.Clr.All += Print;
                source.Kernel.All += Print;
                source.Dynamic.All += Print;

                // iterate over the file, calling the callbacks.  
                source.Process();
            }
        }

        static void Print(TraceEvent data)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(data.ToString());
        }
    }
```

# TraceEvent Samples 

To see more complete samples that use the APIs in more sophisticated (but not too
sophisticated ways).   In the directory 

* https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview/tree/master/src/TraceEvent/Samples

There are one or two page samples doing interesting things (collecting data, parsing from files or
in real time, transforming one ETL file to another etc).    Each sample is independent of the others.

One way of getting the samples is to walk through the step by step guide in

* [Vance's Walkthough on TraceEvent](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vancem/2014/03/15/walk-through-getting-started-with-etw-traceevent-nuget-samples-package/)_

This walk-through uses TraceEvent Samples package, however this code is old (but still completely relevant
the APIs have not changed).   These samples are exactly the samples in Github mentioned above.  

The easiest way to build the latest samples is to simply clone the [PerfView Repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview) and and build it.   THe samples are in the 'TraceEventSamples' 
project in the PerfView solution.   Simply set this project to be your 'Startup Project' (right click
on it in Solution Explorer -> Set as Startup Project) and run it (F5)  By default will run all the samples. 

# Release Notes for the Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent library. 

* Release Notes - the [Releases](https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview/releases) page 
for PerfView also shows the releases for the TraceEvent library.   Note that PerfView's 
version numbers and TraceEvent Version numbers are not kept in lock step. 
The version numbers that begin with T are for TraceEvent, the ones with V coorespond to PerfView.
